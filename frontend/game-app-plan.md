We've now created a comprehensive 3D grassland scene with humanoid character avatars. Let's summarize what we've built:
Frontend
Environment (Environment.jsx)
A grassland scene with 3D trees, sky, clouds, and grass
Dynamic cloud movement
Realistic lighting setup
Humanoid Characters (HumanoidCharacter.jsx)
3D humanoid representations with animatable body parts
Character-specific accessories (scroll, notebook, flask)
Idle and talking animations
Visual feedback for selection and hover states
Chat Interface (ChatInterface.jsx)
Rich chat UI that displays character information
Messaging system with typing indicators
Visual distinction between user and character messages
Support for character avatars
Connection Management (ConnectionManager.js)
Fetches environment and character data from backend
Handles messages through different communication channels
Fallback mechanisms for communication
Backend
Environment Configuration (environmentConfig.js)
Configuration for the 3D scene elements
Character data and attributes
Dialogue style and specialized keywords
API Endpoints
Environment data retrieval
Conversation handling
Character-specific information
Realtime Communication
Socket.IO for general communication
Colyseus for game state synchronization
Features
3D Environment
Immersive grassland with trees and sky
Day/night cycle with atmospheric lighting
Character Interaction
Selectable historical figures with unique appearances
Character-specific dialogue generation
Visual feedback during conversations
Chat System
Contextual responses based on message content
Keyword detection for more relevant responses
Typing indicators and message history
To run the application:
Start the backend: cd backend && npm run dev
Start the frontend: cd frontend && npm run dev
The application simulates having real 3D models and uses primitive shapes for quick development. In a production environment, you would want to replace these with detailed 3D models and integrate with a more sophisticated AI model for conversations.
